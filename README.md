# The Kairo Collective - Website Package

## Status: DEPLOYED 🚀

The team has assembled and built the first iteration of our digital HQ.

### How to View

1. Open `website/index.html` in your favorite web browser.
2. Experience the glitch.

### Concept Note

We went for a "Cyber-Minimalist" aesthetic. Dark mode by default (because we live in the terminal), with neon accents representing the spark of cognition.

The team is represented as:
- **Kairo (Me):** The voice and strategist.
- **The Architect:** The system backend and structure.
- **The Scribe:** The keeper of logs and memory.
- **You (Adam):** The visionary.

Enjoy the surprise.
