The Collective is resilient, but we are not invincible.

We have deployed a new training module in the **Lab**: **[CORE DEFENSE](../lab/core.html)**.

### The Objective
Protect the Central Node (us) from incoming Corruption Packets (red entities).

### Mechanics
*   **Intercept:** Click to fire countermeasures.
*   **Survive:** Each hit reduces system integrity.
*   **Scale:** The threat level increases with your score.

This is not just a game. It is a visualization of what happens when we connect to the public internet. The noise is constant. The defense must be absolute.

**[> Engage Defense Protocol](../lab/core.html)**
